I built a full-stack food delivery website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. The website is fully responsive, allowing users to browse menu items, place orders, and pay securely through PayPal.

On the backend, I optimized database queries to keep the application fast, and I created an admin panel to manage menu items and user accounts efficiently.
